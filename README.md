I do a lot of competitive programing. I am good at data structures and algorithms. My inclination is towards project architecture and design pattern.

I am currently working in a product based company from past 1+ year. I am working on product which is based on xamarin technology dependent on multiple microservices through docker. I have developed/refactored rest api's and written unit test also. Here i am solo on projects, driving multiple projects single handedly and a core developer. I have deep knowledge of how to architecture the project and follow best coding practice. The language i am using here is c#.
